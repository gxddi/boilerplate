# Model Architectures in Torch

Readable C++ implementations of common model architectures, built as native Torch module's.
Supports loading models from HuggingFace model directory and safetensors.

A diggestible set of files letting you easily match and find suitable architectures, small enough to read in one sitting and change when a model doesn't fit.

Currently implemented: 
- **Gemma 3**

## Use

```cpp
#include <modules/tokenizer.hpp>
#include <modules/model.hpp>

torch::Device device(torch::kCPU);
const char *path = "models/embeddinggemma-300m/"; // trailing slash

torch::nn::Sequential model = load_modules(path, device);
Tokenizer tokenize = load_tokenizer(path, device);
if (!model || !tokenize) {
  return 1; // both test like pointers, empty means loading failed
}

torch::Tensor embedding = model->forward(tokenize("hello world"));
```
